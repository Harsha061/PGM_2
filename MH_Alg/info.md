# Metropolis Hastings Algorithm for sampling from gamma distribution

We sample from $Gamma(k,\theta)$ distribution using normal distribution at current state $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ as proposal distribution.

The script `mp_python.py` creates a [webpage](https://harsha061.github.io/PGM_2/plots/MH_Summary.html) containong **histogram plots, trace plots and acceptance rates**.
